# Play-Me-a-Song
This is a blazor web application that connects to my spotify and exposes a page to the internet that anyone can navigate to, search for a song and click play on the song and it will play on my Spotify account if I'm currently listening to Spotify or it will add the song to a playlist if I'm not listening right at the moment.

It was live for a while but not anymore.
